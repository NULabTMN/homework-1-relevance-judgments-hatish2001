            The Mauretanla and Lusitania of not much more than half the proposed crafts tonnage have no more room than they need to get through the Ambrose channel and Into the Mersey at Liverpool. The popular opinion here is that a vessel of 60,000 tons would have to do its loading and unloading at sea. Considerable progress is being made with construction work on the Olympic in Harland Wolff's yard at Belfast, but the Titanic keel blocks will not be laid until January.

            The White Star company Is to have two of these leviathans and they will be In commission early in 1911. Their launching will signalize a most important era in marine achievement for they will be by all odds the largest vessels in the world. The Titanic and Olympic will each be 880 feet in length, 92 feet beam, 45,000 tons register and 60,000 tons displacement.

            Alexander M. Carlisle...of the big shipbuilding firm of Harland & Wolff, at Belfast...talked about the new thousand-foot ocean giants that are soon to leave the yards at Belfast... He declared that the Olympic and Titanic would burst upon the world when they come here in 1911.
            'Work on these big steamships is going on night and day,' he said, 'and we will have the Olympic ready for launching in October. Nothing can compare with them in size and beauty. You will get a revelation in room and decoration when these vessels come to New York.'"
            "The Olympic and the Titanic will have a speed of 21 knots... The staterooms will be unusually large, and there will be an abundance of room everywhere. For example, we will have an exceedingly large room off the dining saloon where people may meet before dinner and hold receptions. The decorations will be unsurpassed. They will be the most magnificent, but also the most substantial and solid that ever were put into a steamship."
            "We will launch the Olympic in October, and she should be in service in the middle of 1911. The Titanic will probably be ready about three or four months after the Olympic sails on her maiden passage.

            MONSTER LINER LAUNCHED.
            Steamer Titanic Slides Into Water at Belfast.
            BELFAST, May 31.— Enthusiastic crowds lined the banks of the River Lagan and cheered lustily as the White Star Line's great steamer Titanic was launched with appropriate ceremonies this morning.
            The Titanic will enter the White Star's New York-Southampton service late in the year, but her sister vessel Olympic steams from Southampton two weeks hence for New York, and these two sea monsters, each 45,000 tons register, 882½ feet long and 92½ feet broad, boast the distinction of being the largest and finest vessels in the world. These massive ships are also notable for the enchanting beauty and the unusual spaciousness of their passenger accommodations, and in first, second, and third class the greatest comfort is promised. On both steamers, swimming pools, tennis and handball courts, and Turkish and electric bath establishments are among the innovations introduced for the pleasure of the passengers."

            "London, April 3— The gigantic new steamship Titanic of the White Star line arrived today at Southampton from the yards of her builders at Belfast. She is to be made ready for her maiden trip across the Atlantic, the start of which is scheduled for Wednesday of next week. The Titanic is a sister ship to the Olympic. She is 882½ feet long and has a displacement of 45,000 tons. The traveling list on the big ship will have 600 names on its first-class roll, in addition to 500 second-class and third-cabin passengers. To this will be added the crew of 890, making a total floating population of nearly 2,000."

          "London, April 10.— Carrying 1400 passengers, the liner Titanic of the White Star Line, than which there is no larger vessel afloat, sailed from Southampton today on her maiden voyage bound for New York. The Titanic which is of 45,000 tons displacement is a sister ship to the Olympic."
          "All the special suites of rooms instituted as an innovation in the Titanic were occupied when the passage began. These suites consist of bedrooms, sitting rooms, bathrooms, and servant's rooms, and have their own private deck promenade isolated from the rest of the ship and not overlooked by any other passengers."
          "The Titanic also possesses another new feature in its Louis XVI. restaurant. Her sister ship, the Olympic, also has this feature but on a smaller scale. It proved so popular, however, that the White Star Company decided to have the one on the Titanic greatly enlarged."

            But the great Boston fire of 1872 proved an impressive object lesson. Guarded by troops, the Union safe deposit vaults were a center of excitement. Frantic box holders, alarmed by the annihilation of property on every side, had to be forcibly restrained from taking possession of their valuables. After the fire was over, it was found that properly constructed vaults preserved their contents unharmed, while safes of the very best make could offer no effectual resistance to the fire.

            England. Tho exceptions are tho great
            Boston fire of 1872, which destroyed be
            tween eighty and ninety millions of dol
            lars worth of property, and the Portland
            firo of 1800, which caused a loss of be
            tween ten and twelve millions.
            Yesterday's fire started at 11:55 a. m.,
            raged over ' eight hours, devastated a
            square mile of the business section of tho
            city and caused a loss estimated at 10,-
            000,000. in tact, the greater part or
            Ward 4 is wiped out as regards the im
            portant shoo manufacturing blocks and
            prominent places of business.
            Tho firo started m Mower's wooden
            building on Almont street, over the
            boiler, and spread with such rapidity
            that the excellent fire department of the
            city was powerless to cope with it This
            largo wooden building was soon doomed,
            and tho flames leaped across a narrow
            passago way and communicated with
            the six-story brick block known as
            Mower's block. When theso two build
            ings got well under way it was evident
            a terrible conflagration would result.
            Simultaneously the four-story wooden
            shoe factory of Bennett & Bernard on
            Central avenuo and the four-story wood
            en building on Almont street caught fire,
            and when undor way a hurricane of
            flame was in progress which blanched
            tho cheeks of all who were looking on.
            For eight hours the flames had full sway,
            tho efforts of firemen and citizens seem
            ingly being of no avail. The burned
            territory Is bounded by the following
            named streets: Almont, Central avenuo
            at its junction with Wilson Btreet, Union
            street from its junction with Broad to
            tho Boyden block on both sides, Mt.
            "Vernon street entire, Central square on
            tire; Beach street on both Bides as far
            down as Lees lumber yard; Washington
            stroet from Monroe through to Union,
            Railroad avenue, all of Exchange street,
            Broad street, from the engine house on
            both sides up as far as the corner of Ex
            change; Spring street entire, besides
            dwelling houses too numerous to men
            tion on Suffolk, Amity, Sagamore and
            Beach &treets.After the fire had been Durning two
            hours, everybody agreed that it would
            not stop until it had reached tho ocean,
            and tins proved to be tho cose. Four
            daily newspapers ore burned out Tho
            Item, Bee, Press and Nowb, three after
            noon and one morning. Three National

            National, together with tho Lynn insti
            tution for savings, located in tho First
            National block, aro all wiped out.
            Twelve of the finest shoe blocks in tho

            OBSERVATIONS ON THE!
            GREAT BOSTON FIRE
            OF 1872
            A bundle of newspapers lie before
            me, dated November 11, 1872, the da>
            after the great Boston fire; it was
            Saturday night, the 9th, when it broke
            out; it raged all of that night and I
            Sunday forenoon, during the latter)
            day news of it reached me a hundred
            miles away; Monday I went there,!
            and found soldiers on guard all about 1
            the burnt district; 1 was supplied with I
            a newspaper pass and began my in-1
            vestigations, and familiar as I had
            been with that city since childhood,'
            although having never had a home
            there, 1 had to stop many times to
            decide which of two outlines of
            streets was the proper one; only those
            who have seen a greaf city after be
            ing devastated by fire can imagine the
            great change which it makes. After
            receiving my pass from the police
            department I went to Washington
            street and stood at the head of Milk
            street; an my left hand was the Old
            South Church of historic fame; across
            that street one building and beyond
            that only a vista of ruins, actually
            smoking ruins, and from where 1
            stood I could look out on to the har
            bor; here and there stood a stone pil
            lar or two with the crossbeam, re
            minding me of the familiar pictures of
            ancient ruins. I had often wondered
            how big cities could be so completely
            destroyed as multitudes of great ones
            have been; but with that first sight of
            the Boston ruuis I understood it;
            twentyfour hourse had made the busy
            business part a ruin; I sought out the
            street where a nephew had been a
            clerk in a hardware store; I located
            the point where the great store had
            stood; nothing remained except melt
            ed piles of iron and steel goods; from
            among them I took what had been a
            package of carpet tacks, melted into
            one mass; that night my nephew told
            me how on Sunday when he got to
            the store the fire was several blocks
            away, and he and his associates began
            removing the stock, the fire creeping
            nearer all the while, till suddenly the
            flames burst into the back end of the
            store, it seeming as though the fire
            swept through the room as fast as
            they could run out of it."Why the flames should have march
            ed steadily to the windward against
            all common reason but repeats what
            great conflagrations have jefore ex
            hibited as a curiosity of fire. At the
            Journal office when the fire broke out
            there was no sense of insecurity (it
            was a third of a mile distant), and
            even after Summer street was a mass
            of flames (an eighth of a mile away).
            Why should there be? The wind blew
            steadily in the direction to carry the
            fire away from us. Still, with a malig
            nant relentlessness the fire reached
            towards us against the wind. It is
            said that the rarifying of the air aid
            ed by the wind creates a vacuum that
            is filled again by the flames and creeps
            along licking up everything in its
            way, and making its march really a
            backward one."

                Subjoined we print a letter from a
                prominent physician in the East con
                cerning the alleged existence of the
                plague in San Francisco. We know that
                no San Francisco daily would print this
                letter, and we very much doubt whether
                any other San Francisco paper would
                print it. But the Argonaut would be
                unworthy of the trust in which its read
                ers hold it which trust is evidenced by
                the language of this letter were we to
                refuse to print an honest expression of
                opinion because we did not agree wiih
                the writer. Dr. Brumer says:
                247 State St., Albany N. T.,
                November 10, 190L
                Editors Argonaut As a constant
                reader and admirer of the Argonaut,
                and as a physician, I take the liberty j
                of writing to you.
                In your issue of October 2S, 1901, you
                write an editorial on the plague situa
                tion, in which you, Indirectly it is true,
                support the statement of the commis- ;
                sion of the State Board of Health
                "that there was not then and never
                had been a case of plague in San Fran
                cisco." Sur-lv vou have failed to inform
                ' yourself on the other side of this Ques- .
                tion. Let me refer you to articles on '
                j the plague by Drs. Baker, Flexner and
                Novy in the American Journal of the
                I Medical Sciences for October, 1901.
                I These articles were partly based on a :
                study of plague cases made in San
                ' Franciseo. Let me further refer you ;
                to an article headed "San Francisco ;
                Plague Report," In the Journal of the
                American Medical Association of Octo-
                ; ber f. 1901. In this report, two certain
                j cases of plague and one probable case
                are reported. These cases are publish
                ' ed since the report of your commission.
                but some time before your editorial.
                , That the city authorities were cogni
                zant of them is shown by the fact that
                the city bacteriologist. Dr. Kellogg, is
                ' reported to have examined one ease.
                1 1 would further call your attention to
                : the fact that the report of the commis
                sion, which you support, though it may
                ! satisfy the lay mind, is sadly larking
                in some points from a medical stand
                point. It states that plague was not
                the cause of death, but does not state
                what did cause death, nor who con
                ducted the examinations.
                J I WOOld not take the trouble to write
                to yon if I did not feel that you fall
                to appreciate the gravity of the stand
                . which you take. Your steady insistence
                ; that there is no danger of an epidemic
                I leads me to believe that you have been
                misinformed as to certain of the medi
                i eal aspects of the plague. I would
                I merely all your attention to the rec
                ognised fact that many epidemics of
                plague besin by the appearance of spo
                radic cases of a relatively mild type,
                Sltcn cases often lasting over months
                or even years, and being followed by
                explosive and widespread outbreaks
                ol tin disease It is through this stage
                ' of sporadic cases that San Francisro
                ! is now going, and the possibility of an
                extensive outbreak can not be denied,
                j Would it not be better candidly to ac
                knowledge the presence of the disease
                and counsel vigorous action for its ex
                termination, rather than to lull ine
                citizens into a sense of false security
                by editorials such as the one I have
                referred to?

                Honolulu is quarantining against San Francisco on account of the epidemic of bubonic plague now in the Coast city, and hereafter every vessel leaving San Francisco for Hawaii ports will be required to be fumigated before departure and receive the certificate of the health authorities at San Francisco that the ship and crew have undergone quarantine.
                Though Honolulu has been a clean port for months, the California health authorities have required that vessels leaving here for San Francisco be fumigated, and otherwise handled here prior to departure, the Honolulu quarantine service certifying to such handling. Now Honolulu quarantines against San Francisco, and the ports are quarantined against each other.
                Dr. Carl Ramus, assistant surgeon, United States Marine Hospital service, for this port, in charge in the absence of Dr. Cofer, yesterday received from Washington cabled instructions to at once apply the quarantine to all vessels from San Francisco on account of an epidemic of bubonic plague there.
                San Francisco has been doing everything possible to keep quiet the fact of plague existing there and has been most demanding in requiring that vessels undergo quarantine and be fumigated here before leaving for that city or be held up there for several days under the yellow flag. San Francisco seemed to fear that plague might be introduced there from this port, whereas there are good reasons to believe, now, that the few cases of plague which have occurred on this island in past months may have been brought here from San Francisco.
                Plague conditions are serious in San Francisco. John Kelly, the Sierra's coal passer who had the disease, came from E street, near the Ferry building, San Francisco, in the district from which numerous cases of plague were taken.
                The orders from Washington, sent to San Francisco and to this port, ordering boats leaving the Golden Gate to leave clean for Hawaii and ordering Honolulu to see that they get here clean, in order to protect Honolulu from the San Francisco plague, double the burden on all vessels plying between the two ports.

                UNTENABLE THEORY.
                That plague was introduced into San Francisco from Honolulu is not a tenable theory; yet there will be plenty of people up there ready to jump at such a conclusion. The passengers who have gone up to the Coast have all been cabin passengers, people who have not been exposed to infection by living in crowded tenement houses or in the crowded portions of the city. They have always been under the surveillance of Dr. Carmichael for fifteen days before leaving. Their baggage has been most carefully fumigated here before going on board, and has again been fumigated upon its arrival in San Francisco.
                The plague center in San Francisco is, as it was here, Chinatown. Now the Hawaiian passengers who have gone from here to San Francisco certainly did not take up their abode in Chinatown. They kept as far away from it as possible. With a Chinatown of our own, which we have been only too happy to have got rid of, the Chinatown of San Francisco could have no attraction for our people. If, therefore, it had been possible for any passenger to have taken the infection from here, the plague cases would not have broken out in San Francisco's Chinatown, but in some other part of the city. It has not done so, and the case is clearly in our favor. No infection was carried or could have been carried by passengers and their baggage.
                Next, it may be claimed that goods carried it up. Now, as a fact, no goods have been shipped from Honolulu. Whatever sugar has gone out of this harbor has been transferred to vessels in the stream from clean steamers which have carried the freight from plantations where there has not been a trace of plague. Indeed, it is wonderful that we have been able to isolate our people so thoroughly and confine the plague to so small an area. Moreover, the cargoes that have gone from here have not gone into Chinese hands. Not a pound of freight has gone from Honolulu to San Francisco's Chinatown. Had our products been infected, the disease would have appeared in some other part of San Francisco. It did not so appear. It was not and could not be infected because it came from places which were uninfected. The wolf charged the lamb who was below him for troubling the stream, and to charge that Honolulu carried infection to San Francisco savors very much of the same style of argument.
                We have never satisfactorily decided how plague came to us. The probability is that it came in certain China food. Some of this probably became too offensive even for the Celestial stomach and was thrown into backyards to rot and fester after the approved Celestial fashion. The rats banquetted upon the garbage, assimilated the microbes, and started the ball rolling. From the rats, as is usual, the plague spread to the human family. That is one theory. If this theory be correct, the same process would certainly bring about the plague in San Francisco.
                The San Francisco Chinese are far more addicted to Chinese food than the Hawaiian Chinese. The place reeks with rotting delicacies, as any one's nose will tell him if he has ever passed through the Chinese quarter of that city. Any quantity of Chinese comestibles are imported into San Francisco direct from Hongkong and other Chinese ports. The Hawaiian Islands have nothing to do with these imports, and it is in them that the danger of plague to San Francisco lies.
                Another theory about plague is that the germs breed in filth. If that is so, the filth of Chinatown is quite abundant enough to breed the microbes itself. San Francisco will have to seek the cause of its outbreak within its own portals, and not look to Hawaii as a pest-bearing center.

                WASHINGTON PASSES ON THE SAN FRANCISCO PLAGUE
                As a result of a final decision that its Chinatown is infected with plague, San Francisco is renovating and disinfecting Chinatown, under the supervision of an officer of the United States Marine Hospital service. The Government health authorities at Washington finally took the matter up, and there appears to be no further doubt that plague has existed for some time, in the Chinese quarters of San Francisco. Information on the subject is so successfully kept from the public that only the scientific journals tell the story. The following review of the situation from the Literary Digest gives the history of the case, and shows how the Federal authorities finally got tired of Frisco faking:

                The Plague Scare in San Francisco
                The Post of March 21st, the day the Mariposa left, has the following on the San Francisco plague affair:
                The Health Department is about to make its second assault upon the sanitary and other conditions of Chinatown, and with the rising sun tomorrow nearly 200 stalwart employees of the department will enter upon the task of uprooting evil spots, turning untidy stalls into the streets, destroying undesirable or dangerous structures and fixtures, burning tainted provisions, and flushing out hidden retreats and many nooks which have not been in speaking terms with pure water for many a day.
                A hundred deputies are being instructed in the work of reclamation today, and tomorrow morning they will swoop down upon the offending quarter and apply the hose and broom with vigor. Fifty police officers especially detailed for the work are to aid and many others are to take part who have hitherto been engaged elsewhere by the health officers.
                An order was issued early this morning, instructing the garbage collectors to leave their loads in Chinatown today, to be burned there. This is in order to prevent the stuff even being carried through the streets of the city. On a vacant lot near Dupont and Clay streets, a force of men was at work all day today burning up the garbage and debris as it was brought to them.
                A death at 723 Sacramento Street, another at 905 Dupont Street, and a third in Oneida Place are the fatalities that stimulated the Health Board to immediate action, and from these it is feared a number of other deaths will soon follow. While the authorities do not claim that the bubonic plague has lifted its head or broken out under cover, they do claim that the filth and poor sanitary conditions of the district have caused an epidemic among the Chinese which may any day develop into the plague and become widespread. In the three cases mentioned, the cause of death has not been definitely known, and the authorities intimate that it may be the plague in a mild form. It is this state of affairs that has led to the campaign against uncleanness and stagnation in the houses and streets of the Oriental district.
                Glands from the three subjects which have now puzzled the authorities are under examination, but no positive verdict has been rendered by Dr. Kinyoun, the Federal bacteriologist, and Dr. Kellogg in the municipal service. The authorities will neither assert nor deny that the cases are those of bubonic plague.

                QUARANTINE NOW AGAINST SAN FRANCISCO
                Honolulu is quarantining against San Francisco on account of the epidemic of bubonic plague now in the Coast city, and hereafter every vessel leaving San Francisco for Hawaii ports will be required to be fumigated before departure and receive the certificate of the health authorities at San Francisco that the ship and crew have undergone quarantine.
                Though Honolulu has been a clean port for months, the California health authorities have required that vessels leaving here for San Francisco be fumigated and otherwise handled here prior to departure, with the Honolulu quarantine service certifying to such handling. Now, Honolulu quarantines against San Francisco, and the ports are quarantined against each other.
                Dr. Carl Ramus, assistant surgeon, United States Marine Hospital service, for this port, in charge in the absence of Dr. Cofer, yesterday received from Washington cabled instructions to at once apply the quarantine to all vessels from San Francisco on account of an epidemic of bubonic plague there.
                San Francisco has been doing everything possible to keep quiet the fact of plague existing there and has been most demanding in requiring that vessels undergo quarantine and be fumigated here before leaving for that city or be held up there for several days under the yellow flag
